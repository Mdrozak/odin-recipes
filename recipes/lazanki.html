        <h3 class="description justif">Steps</h3>
        <ol class="ono-list">
            <li>
                I recommend cooking the sauerkraut first. Place at least 400 grams of sauerkraut in the pot 
                (the weight of the cabbage squeezed out of excess water). Also pour two glasses of water into the pot. 
                Add two smaller bay leaves and three allspice seeds.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cover the pot with cabbage and cook for about 25 minutes, or until the cabbage becomes soft.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place the cabbage in a bowl to cool down faster. Then remove the leaves and herb and squeeze 
                out the water thoroughly. Chop the cabbage finely and set aside. You can perform the above 
                steps while cooking pasta or frying onion in oil.
            </li>
            <li>
                Start heating a medium-sized frying pan. Put all the vegetable oil on it. You can also use 
                good quality lard or render bacon cut into small cubes or ground in a food processor.
            </li>
            <li>
                Peel two onions and chop finely. Immediately put all the mushrooms or wild mushrooms 
                (porcini mushrooms, bay boletes, peeled butter mushrooms...) cut into smaller pieces into the pan. 
                Fry everything for 20-25 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place about 200 grams of slightly dried sausage cut into half-slices into the pan with onion 
                and mushrooms. Mix everything and fry for up to 20 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Also add the drained water and shredded cabbage to the pan. Mix everything and fry for another 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                You can cook the pasta while frying the onion and mushrooms. Cook two cups of dry noodles, i.e. 240 grams 
                of noodles, in salted water according to the instructions on the package. Drain the pasta, cover with a lid 
                and set aside. After cooking, I got 500 grams of pasta.
            </li>
            <li>
                Mix all cooked pasta thoroughly with the ingredients from the pan. Add half a teaspoon of salt and pepper a
                nd a pinch of ground or whole cumin. Mix everything again and check the taste of the dish. Add more salt or 
                pepper if necessary. You can also add more oil if necessary.
